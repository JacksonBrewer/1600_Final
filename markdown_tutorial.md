# Markdown tutorial 

### What is Markdown?
markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext documents. The text is then converted to HTML. Markdown was created by John Gruber in 2004.

When a Markdown-formmatted file is created, the user adds Markdown syntax to specifiy how words and phrases should look. 

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. A Markdown document should look as if it were a .txt file, with no markups or formatting instructions. 

### File Extentions
